## What is Solid?

Solid is a declarative JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Instead of using a Virtual DOM, it compiles its templates to real DOM nodes and updates them with fine-grained reactions. Declare your state and use it throughout your app, and when a piece of state changes, only the code that depends on it will rerun.

## Introduction

Meticulously engineered for performance and with half a decade of research behind it, Solid's performance is almost indistinguishable from optimized vanilla JavaScript (See Solid on the JS Framework Benchmark). Solid is small and completely tree-shakable, and fast when rendering on the server, too.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
