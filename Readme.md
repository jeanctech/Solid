## What is Qwik?

Qwik is a new fast and lightweight web framework that focuses on performance and modular development. Here's an introduction. Qwik lets you build web applications by compiling components into efficient JavaScript. It was created by the Builder.io team led by Tim Kadlec aiming to fix performance problems with some current frameworks.

## Introduction

In summary, Qwik focuses on radically fast render times through optimized and compiled components along with partial hydration and time-slicing techniques. It aims to bring a snappy native-app feel to the web efficiently. The project is open source and being developed publicly on GitHub by talented engineers like Evan You (Vue.js creator). Qwik definitely seems promising for the future of web development with its innovative performance ideas.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
